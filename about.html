            I've made this site for the purpose of learning typing in a unique way which should be more effective than simply doing a lot of typing tests.
            The reason being that beyond 100 WPM, it's mostly <b>muscle memory</b> and finger agility that determines improvement and speed.
            <br><br>
            Building muscle memory can certainly be done by practicing a lot but that is not the optimal solution.
            For that reason, I have made it so that every word is repeated 3 times <i>(2 would have been useless, 4 would be overkill)</i> to help build muscle memory faster.
            <br><br>
            I have designed the levels in a way that makes the next level easier than jumping straight into it.
            This is done by getting comfortable with common letter combinations.
            For example, a trigram might have 2 letters common to a bigram previously practiced.
            This makes it much easier to get used to the trigram. Same logic applies going forward.
            <br>
            This method along with general practice (simply using the layout at all times) <i>should</i> likely give satisfactory results.
            <br>
            For people already fast on QWERTY, learning a layout is already a relatively fast process, and this may be able to speed it up even more.

            If you wanted to suggest something time consuming, please keep in consideration the fact that I'm 16 and last year of high school doesn't leave much time for this.
            Nonetheless, feel free to send any email if you want to.
