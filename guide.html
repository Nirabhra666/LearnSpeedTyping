            Firstly, <b>position your fingers as shown.</b>
            <img src="position.png"/>
            Keep in mind that you don't need to keep stationary fingers <i>perfectly</i> over those keys.
            It would be near impossible to do that when typing, so keep it approximate and flexible.
            The point is, you're not supposed to keep your fingers rested randomly nor on the other 2 rows.
            <br>
            For ease, the fingers are mentioned under the keys in the overlay. <b>(L/R = hand,  1 = thumb and so on)</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>Levels 1-4:</b>
            <br>
            Proceed to the next level once you feel you're fast and accurate enough.
            <br><br>
            <b class="extraimp">[ALT FINGERING] Levels 5-6:</b>
            <br>
            This is by far the <b>most important step.</b>
            Since there will always be words with awkward fingering or with SFBs (mentioned previously) regardless of layout, they need to be countered.
            The solution is to use <b>different fingers</b> than the assigned.
            <br>
            It is highly recommended to learn most taught here.
            Aside from those, pause and take your time thinking of the optimal solution whenever you encounter such slow words.
            <br>
            That is how I was able to find all the major ones.
            <br>
            Make sure to complete the word list for both levels. Practice is a must for fluid alting.
            <br><br>
            <b>Levels 7-9:</b>
            <br>
            Levels 8 and 9 aren't in order of difficulty but near the end due to falling in the miscellaneous category.
            These 3 levels are useful for people not learning the Whorf X layout too.
            <br>
            Make sure to <b>look out for altable words</b> yourself as there's no overline above the letters.<br><br>
            <b class="extraimp">[EXTRAS] Level 10:</b>
            <br>
            This list contains more words such as special alts and hard (slow or long) words.
            <br>
            I have included the overline and tips for this level too to aid with the altable words.
            <br><br>
            <b>Good luck! I may make videos upon requests, you can mail me regarding the same.</b>
