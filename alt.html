            Anyone typing at a decent speed on QWERTY comes to realize how inefficient it is.
            Of course, there is a reason for it: it was designed for typewriters to prevent keys from being jammed.
            <br>
            <b class="extraimp">QWERTY's whole purpose is to slow down the typist!</b>
            <br><br>
            Long gone are the days of typewriters yet it remains to be used by nearly all keyboards.
            Luckily, there are already plenty of alternate layouts one can use.
            They can be <b>installed on a device</b> for permanent usage <b>OR</b> be used via a <b>pen-drive.</b>
            <br><br>
            The next <i>"problem"</i> is which layout to choose?
            Unfortunately for you, free will is an illusion.
            This site will help you learn the <b>Whorf X</b> layout.
            But worry not, since this layout is far superior to QWERTY stat-wise, boasting <b class="extraimp">89% SFB reduction</b> and <b>38% DSFB reduction.</b>
            <br>
            <i>SFBs are letter combinations using the same finger repeatedly, being drastically slower. DSFBs essentially signify how much you move a finger, their effect is similar to SFBs.</i>
            <br>
            Layout style preferences vary, but in general the goal is a layout with <b>low SFB, DSFB and LSB stats.</b>
            <br><br>
            The layout <i>whorf</i> has the lowest SFB stat (0.667%) for a certain corpus but wasn't great for use.
            With another person's help, I individually tackled all the major problems pointed out.
            <br><br>
            The result was a layout with negligibly higher (0.682%) SFBs but <i>"altable"</i> SFBs and improved comfort.
            Improved comfort should also correlate to speed since performing awkward motions are slow and cause typos.
            Since 9 (~35%) of the 26 letters are repositioned, it provides a completely different typing experience despite <i>looking</i> somewhat similar.
