            Needless to say, the first step is to download and install the Whorf X layout.
            The Google Drive link below will have the necessary downloads as well as a text file explaining the steps for ease:

            <br><br>
            If you have any problems, try finding the solution online or try asking on the AKL discord server or the related subreddits.

            Links to both can be found in the External Resources section.

            For the time being, you <b>don't need to have the layout to proceed.</b>
            <br>
            By clicking on <b>"Enable Emulation"</b> button you will be able to toggle between your default input and converted Whorf X inputs.
            <br><br>
            However, this <b>will work only on the site.</b>
            To learn faster, it is recommended to resolve any installation errors as soon as possible.
