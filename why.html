        <legend><h1><b>Why</b> is it important to type fast?</h1></legend>
        <p>
            The average <b>thinking speed</b> varies a lot, but can easily cross <b>1000 WPM</b> (words per minute) and reach as high as 3000 WPM.
            <br>
            The average reading speed is much slower but it is still around 250 WPM, with fast readers being able to go beyond 500 WPM.
            <br>
            Yet even slower is the average talking speed, which is around 150 WPM.
            <br><br>
            Being unable to type at the speed of your thoughts can be extremely annoying since you may forget and confuse words.
            More importantly, it is <b>wasting a LOT of your time.</b>
            The average typing speed ranges from 40 - 60 WPM, meaning that you're working at <b>less than 30% efficiency</b> in general.
            This figure is so low that there's no need for calculations to realize how cruicial improvement is.
            <br><br>
            I have a <b>personal best of 179 WPM</b> on a 1 minute typing test.
            Sounds crazy fast?
            Well, it turns out that I can only average around <b>140 WPM on proper text</b> such as quotes from books.
            This already falls below the average talking speed, forget approaching reading or thinking speeds.
            <br><br>
            Even if these numbers are to be kept aside, from my own experience I can confidently claim that someone with under 200 WPM on a typing test is inefficient.
            <br>
            Of course, most people do not have the time to get that fast, but <b>even reaching 100 WPM means that they are twice as fast</b> as before.
